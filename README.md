# Education-MindA.I.lytics

### Education-MindA.I.lytics is a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using PyTorch that can analyze images of students.

The system can analyze images to recognize four distinct facial recognition classes notably: **happy, neutral, engaged, and surprised.**

For this project, we focused exclusively on utilizing the **FER-2013 dataset** due to its comprehensive collection of facial images annotated with various attributes.

The project is divided into three main stages:
* Part 1: Data Collection, Cleaning, Labeling & Preliminary Analysis.
* Part 2: CNN Model Development and Basic Evaluation.
* Part 3: Bias Analysis, Model Refinement & Deep Evaluation.

⚠️Unfortunately, the original code is publicly **unavailable** to meet Concordia University's Academic Integrity Regulations.⚠️
